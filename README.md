## Hey, I’m Esha 👋

Self-taught web developer on a mission to turn chaos into code — one project, one bug, one breakthrough at a time.

Currently learning the foundations of:
- JavaScript (one console.log at a time)
- React (yes, I'm still wrapping my head around `useEffect`)
- Tailwind CSS (✨ because why not look good while breaking things?)

Also slowly exploring the magical world of **cybersecurity** 🔐

### 🌱 What I’m Working On:
- Rebuilding my projects with custom backend
- Blogging my dev journey at [Code & Chaos](#) (writing in progress!)
- Finally building on my own — and not looking back 😤

---

### 💻 Tech I’m Currently Learning:
HTML • CSS • JavaScript • React • Tailwind CSS • Firebase • Python (baby steps)  
Bonus round: ethical hacking & CTFs 🕵️‍♀️
